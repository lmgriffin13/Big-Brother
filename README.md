# Big-Brother
This is an analysis of demographics and competition wins of the 22 seasons of regular Big Brother as well as the spin offs, Over the Top and Celebrity. There is also a model which is intended to predict what place a Houseguest would come in, given demographics, game type, and competition wins.
